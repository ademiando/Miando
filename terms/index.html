  <h2>1. Our Role</h2>
  <p>Montamap acts as a technology provider and marketplace for adventure experiences. We do not organize or operate treks, nor act as an agent or representative for local guides, porters, or travel operators. All services listed on Montamap are provided by independent third-party providers.</p>

    <li>You are responsible for your own safety and decisions during any outdoor activity</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. User Responsibility</h2>
  <p>You understand that all trekking, hiking, or outdoor exploration involves inherent risks, including injury, weather-related hazards, or loss of property. Montamap is not liable for any incident that occurs before, during, or after your trip.</p>

  <h2>4. Platform Status</h2>
  <p>Montamap is currently a pre-registered startup project under development and not yet incorporated as a legal entity in any jurisdiction. Services are offered in beta for exploratory and pilot use. Use of this platform is at your own discretion and you acknowledge the experimental nature of certain features.</p>

  <h2>5. Content & Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All content on Montamap (text, logos, icons, map data, software, etc.) is the intellectual property of Montamap or its licensors. You may not:</p>

  <p>You retain ownership of your photos, reviews, and content you share—but grant Montamap a non-exclusive license to display and distribute that content.</p>

  <h2>6. Payments & Bookings</h2>
  <p>Payments made through the platform (when available) are processed by third-party providers. Montamap does not collect or hold payment information directly. All bookings are made between the user and the listed service provider. Montamap is not responsible for refund policies, cancellations, or service delivery unless explicitly stated.</p>
